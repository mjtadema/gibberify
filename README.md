# INSERT_GIBBERISH_HERE

Gibbery is a simple gibberish generator that translates words from a real language to a pronounceable gibberish.

It uses words taken from [wooorm/dictionaries](https://github.com/wooorm/dictionaries/tree/master/dictionaries).

# Usage

TODO

### Sillable pool generation

You can use the pre-generated syllable pool present in the repo, or you can generate a new one using your preferred languages.

Either way, you can find the code for syllable pool generation in syllable_generator.py

### TODO

- use multiprocessing to speedup syllable pool generation
- add support for non-latin fonts
